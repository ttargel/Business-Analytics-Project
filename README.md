# Business-Analytics-Project

This Business Analytics project is focused on the attempt to optimize the marketing expenses of a product named Yandex.Afisha, in order to attract more users and increase revenues. In order to do so, we will need to study the product's users' usage habits, retention rates, where they came from (the marketing source that introducted them to the product), as well as other metrics such as conversion periods, customer acquisition costs (CAC), lifetime value (LTV), etc.

We will need to compare how these metrics differ between users in different cohorts but mostly between users coming from different marketing sources, since this is what the marketing team can control.

Based on the data, we will give our recommendations about how to optimize the marketing expenses.

In this project, we have used the following libraries/modules:

<ul>
  <li>pandas</li>
  <li>numpy</li>
  <li>matplotlib</li>
  <li>plotly</li>
  <li>seaborn</li>
</ul>

Note: due to technical limitations, the plots generated by the Plotly library appear in the notebook above as pictures, not actual interactive graphs. Running the code above them will produce the same graphs.
